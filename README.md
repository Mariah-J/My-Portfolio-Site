# My-Portfolio-Site
My project is a basic portfolio/resume website. 

The first page is my index.html (“welcome”) page, which contains one of my CSS features: a basic animated button. The button has a transition animation that makes it fade from white to black on hover.
Second is mainpage.html, which is where the main content of the site goes. As I continue to build coding projects and earn certifications, they will be displayed on this page, which is currently occupied by introductory text and a list of the programming languages I currently know or am currently working on. The main page has a navigation bar with a hamburger menu, which was made with CSS and JavaScript for a responsive layout. It has a media query that displays the expanding hamburger menu at screen sizes below 768px. 
Also on the main page is a contact form with JavaScript validation. The “email” and “name” fields are required for submission, and leaving either empty upon submitting will display a message instructing the user to enter their name/email. The contact form also has a media query: On screens below 600px, the contact form fields and image will switch from 2 columns into one column.

Finally, the page about.html is formatted similarly to mainpage.html, but is a simple “about me” page with text and an image. Like the main page, the main content and the aside section are set up as flex columns. It also contains a responsive navbar.

The main page and about me page both have media queries that will make the sections stack on top of each other as columns on screens below 800px. 


3+ required features used:

JavaScript: Validated contact form, responsive navbar

CSS: Animated button on welcome page, flexbox formatting on navbar
