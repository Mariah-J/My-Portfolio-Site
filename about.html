    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div>
            <p>My background is primarily in Food Service. I was in the industry for most of my working life, until I decided to transition into tech jobs.</p>
            <p>After spending some time in an IT position, I decided to learn about web development. I started with FreeCodeCamp, then I learned on the job in my current position, and now I'm working my way through <b><a href="https://www.codelouisville.org/">Code Louisville</a></b>'s Front End Web Development Course.</p>
            <p>After completing Front End, I plan to take a course on Data Analytics with Python.</p>
            <p>When I'm not working on my tech skills, I am working on my bachelor's degree in History.</p>
            <p>I have always had a passion for history, science, and technology. I am always looking for ways to combine the three into projects and experiences. For example, I want to take my Python knowledge and improve on how we catalog historic records and data. I also want to try my hand at game development, creating history-based RPGs.</p>
            <p>In our increasingly tech-driven world, I believe that the collaborative efforts of humanities and STEM is our greatest strength, and I want to be a part of it!</p>
